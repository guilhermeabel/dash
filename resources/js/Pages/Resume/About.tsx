		<h2>hey, I'm Abel</h2>
		<p className="subtitle">Programmer, tech enthusiast, handsome</p>
		<p>
			Hi there! I am a full-stack developer, I'm passionate about creating innovative solutions while following programming best practices. With four years of experience, I have worked on developing web systems for business management, e-commerce, and landing pages.
		</p>
		<p>
			Organizational skills are crucial to me, and I enjoy crafting straightforward yet robust solutions for both my personal and professional projects. I am a fast learner and I am always looking for new challenges.
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe communication is one of the main aspects of modern software development, and I strive to be more transparent and assertive. Collaboration is one of my strengths, but I'm equally comfortable working independently.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides my professional work, I maintain and update Java and C# projects on GitHub to learn different patterns and engage in coding challenges, which allow me to continuously improve my skills.
