		<p>
			I have gained practical software development experience in various positions, starting as a Trainee at IComp IT Solutions. There, I was involved in requirements analysis, project management, and web development using PHP, Laravel, Sass, and MySQL. As a Software Developer at Conex√£o G Tecnologia, I worked on projects ranging from web design to SEO optimization. Currently, I am a Junior Developer at Tiny ERP, where I have honed my skills in PHP, React, TypeScript, MySQL, and Agile methodologies. Through these experiences, I have gained expertise in project management, web design, PHP code review, refactoring, debugging, and component development, among other skills.
